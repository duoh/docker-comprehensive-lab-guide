# Clean up
Whew! We have learned a lot today. There are so many AWS services we deployed and skills we learned.

It's time to clean up now and we wrote a script to help with this.

Note: Please only clean up the resources if you and your teammates are done with ALL resources in this workshop environment.

To run the file, use the following commands:
```sh
cd ~/environment
chmod +x ~/environment/cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```
